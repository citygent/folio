        <p>I’m a Junior Web Developer based in London, I use a variety of bicycles to get around the city.</p>
        <p>I have an arts education, I particularly love to nerd-out about films, typography and design. I have a good eye for how products &amp; services can be better.</p>
        <p>Maybe we could work together?</p>

            <p><a href="http://citygent.github.io">My first GA self-initiated project: A tile-flip memory game.</a></p>
            <p>Visuals are based on signage and computer terminals aboard the setting for Ridley Scott's 1979 Sci-Fi masterpiece, Alien.</p>
            <p>I am a huge fan of this film and wanted this project to be an exercise in front-end, so kept the javascript logic as basic as possible (but please check out the code/readme). As well as jQuery and CSS animation techniques, I learnt about web font handling and layout, as well as adding sound to websites.</p>

            <p><a href="http://dinnerdate.herokuapp.com">A Personal Restaurant MealTracker/Reviewer</a></p>
            <p>This app was born out of frustration at forgetting what I had or hadn’t eaten at a particular restaurant, whether they did a good or a poor version of a dish I was fond of, or even if I’d tried a new dish and liked it or loathed it.</p>
            <p>To help remind me I made an app that uses photos to track Restaurants, Dishes and Meals using the CRUD/RESTful concepts for all three resources.</p>
            <p>I fell in love with Ruby on Rails during this project, and learnt a lot about relational DB’s. I pushed myself to make UX and forms dynamic using jQuery and AJAX and it was also the first time I’d used AWS and Carrierwave for image uploads. I wanted some automation and efficiency to this, so I tacked on Cloudinary for optimisation.</p>

          <a class="work-title" href="#C">Hello Stranger</a>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/citygent/Hello-Stranger">Event and Location based Chatrooms</a></p>
            <p>My idea for this came about during a very long talk at <a href="http://lrug.org/">LRUG</a>, where to keep themselves amused, students were texting each other, other attendees wanted to join in! ‘But why doesn’t this exist?’ I thought: 'We don’t talk to each other enough in this city, so could geo-specific and anonymous (for safety concerns) chatrooms fix this?'</p>
            <p>Thankfully my idea was chosen for our group project, it ticked all the boxes of technologies we wanted to learn; WebSockets, Sessions, Authentication and Geolocation. We built the backend on Node.js using Express, and decided on Mongoose accessing a MongoDB as this was a new DB concept for me, integration of the Google Maps API was key, we also used Eventbrite’s API for fetching local event data, but I would like to add the feature of creating events on the go.</p>
